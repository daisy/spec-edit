			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Finding people to write technical specifications is challenge enough, and the last anything wants when
				taking on this kind of task is to be overwhelmed by the process of managing the documents. To help make
				the process as smooth as possible, DAISY uses two widely implemented tools to help authors and editors
				navigate the ins and outs of specification work: ReSpec and GitHub.</p>

			<p>ReSpec is a tool that lets authors and editors focus on writing the text &#8212; it takes care of
				formatting the document. Consequently, the only thing you have to know to write DAISY specifications is
				some basic HTML. This guide introduces ReSpec and explains its authoring conventions.</p>

			<p>GitHub is a content management system (CMS). Although commonly associated with coding projects, CMSes
				provide a convenient way to author documents. The full authoring history of documents is always
				available, for example, so you never have to worry about making mistakes. They are easily undone. GitHub
				also allows others to review your changes before they are merged into a document.</p>

			<p>Using GitHub can be a little more challenging than using ReSpec, but there are many user tools available
				that can hide the technical details. This guide focuses on the underlying commands to help you
				understand what happens at each stage of the process but is expected that you will use one of the
				available tools to simplify the process.</p>

			<h2>Using GitHub</h2>

			<section id="github-intro">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>GitHub is a cloud-based service that uses git repositories to store and manage development projects.
					It is also a web site through which you can easily maintain repositories.</p>

				<p>Although commonly thought of as a home for open-source code projects, GitHub is useful for any
					project where versioning and tracking of documents is important. It is for this reason that DAISY,
					W3C, and other publishers use GitHub for document development.</p>

				<p>GitHub (the web site) includes some web-based tools for editing files in a repository, but it is more
					common for developers to download repositories to their local machines to work on and then submit
					their changes back to the site. This makes it easy to collaborate with others through the web site
					and track what is happening.</p>

				<p>This section goes through the process of checking out and working on the files in a repository, as
					this is how you will manage the writing and editing of DAISY specifications. As there are many tools
					available to simplify the document management process, this guide focuses on the underlying git
					commands. Once you understand these commands, you will find it much easier to understand the
					graphical user interfaces to GitHub.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="github-tools">
				<h3>Tools for managing repositories</h3>

				<p>The following list introduces some of the most common tools used to manage GitHub repositories. You
					will need to install at least one of these tools before you will be able to checkout files and edit
					them.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git command line</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The git command line is the most basic way to interact with git repositories.</p>
						<p>If you are comfortable with command line tools and do not mind memorizing the various git
							commands, it may be all you need to manage your work locally.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The GitHub desktop is an application that runs on your local computer. It provides a
							graphical user interface for checking out repositories and maintaining the files in them. As
							it comes integrated with GitHub and sets up a connection with your user account, it is very
							beginner friendly.</p>
						<p>One bonus of installing GitHub desktop is that it will install the git command line for you,
							so you can switch to the command line without having to run a separate install.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="https://tortoisegit.org/">TortoiseGit</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>TortoiseGit is an application that runs on Windows systems. It integrates with your
							right-click context menu, allowing you to manage repositories from the file system
							explorer.</p>
						<p>In addition to providing easy access to many common git commands, TortoiseGit also uses icon
							overlays to display which folders and files have changes. Unfortunately, these overlays are
							only accessible to sighted users.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="https://github.com">GitHub web site</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although the GitHub web site is not an installable application, and does not directly allow
							you to download repositories, it does provide some basic tools for maintaining repositories
							and editing files.</p>
						<p>The GitHub site is the only way to open and comment on <a href="#pull-requests">pull
								requests</a>, for example, so you cannot avoid using it. It also allows you to do light
							modifications on files if you are in a hurry, but it is not recommended for extensive
							editing.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section id="github-workflow">
				<h3>Specification editing workflow</h3>

				<p>The typical GitHub workflow for editing a specification is as follows:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><a href="#clone-repo">Clone</a> the repository to your local machine.</li>
					<li><a href="#branch-create">Create a branch</a> to work in.</li>
					<li><a href="#editing">Edit</a> the file(s).</li>
					<li><a href="#commits">Commit</a> your changes.</li>
					<li><a href="#push-changes">Push</a> your changes back to the site.</li>
					<li>Open a <a href="#pull-requests">pull request</a>.</li>
					<li>Repeat from step 2 as needed.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The following sections will go into these steps in more detail.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="clone-repo">
				<h4>Cloning repositories</h4>

				<p>Cloning a repository downloads a copy of the repository to your local machine. Cloning is the
					preferred work mode for DAISY specifications.</p>

				<p>The two most common ways to clone a repository are directly from GitHub and from the git command
					line.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>From the GitHub web site:</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol>
							<li>Go to the site for the repository.</li>
							<li>
								<p>Click on the "<code>&lt;> Code</code>" button.</p>
								<figure>
									<figcaption>GitHub code tab</figcaption>
									<img src="./images/code-tab.png" width="500" alt="" />
									<details>
										<summary>Description</summary>
										<p>The image shows the top of the eBraille repository as it appears on the
											GitHub web site. The green "Code" button is rendered at the right edge of
											the page on a line of links and buttons after the repository name.</p>
									</details>
								</figure>
								<p>(Note for screen reader users that this "button" is actually a <code>details</code>
									element styled like a button.)</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>From the drop-down menu, select "Open with GitHub Desktop" to download. (If you are
									using a different application, this link should open that program instead; you do
									not have to install GitHub Desktop for this step.)</p>
								<figure>
									<figcaption>Code menu</figcaption>
									<img src="./images/code-menu.png" width="300" alt="" />
									<details>
										<summary>Description</summary>
										<p>The image shows the clone option that appears by default in the drop-down
											menu box. The URL for the repository is shown followed by a link to open
											with GitHub desktop and a link to download a ZIP file with the source.</p>
									</details>
								</figure>
							</li>
							<li>You will be prompted where to save the repository on your local filesystem.</li>
						</ol>
						<div class="note">
							<p>Do not download the zipped source. This option only gives you the files without any of
								the other necessary repository information for your git tools to work with them.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>

					<dt>From the git command line:</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a directory for your repositories if necessary.</li>
							<li>Open the command line terminal for your operating system.</li>
							<li>Switch to the directory from step 1.</li>
							<li>Open the GitHub web site for the repository in your browser and copy the URL.</li>
							<li>
								<p>Clone the repository with the command:</p>
								<pre><code>git clone &lt;URL></code></pre>
								<p>Replacing "&lt;URL>" with the URL from step 4.</p>
								<aside class="example" title="Command to clone the DAISY eBraille repository">
									<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/daisy/ebraille/</code></pre>
								</aside>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<div class="note">
							<p>git will automatically create a new subdirectory for the source files using the name of
								the repository.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Another process for working on a repository is called forking. Forking a repository makes a copy
						of the repository under your GitHub account. You then clone that repository and work on it and
						make a pull request back to the source repository when you are done.</p>

					<p>Forking is typically only used when you do not have access to edit the source repository. If you
						need access to a DAISY repository, make a request to DAISY staff.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="branches">
				<h3>Branches</h3>

				<section id="branch-intro">
					<h4>Overview</h4>

					<p>Branches are like copies of the repository source that allow you to work on files without
						directly changing the primary source. After you have finished making all your changes, you
						request that your changes be merged back into the source (through what is called a "<a
							href="#pull-requests">pull request</a>").</p>

					<p>All DAISY specification should be done through branches and pull requests. Do not work directly
						in the "main" branch (the primary source) as it does not give others a chance to review your
						changes.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="branch-create">
					<h4>Create a branch</h4>

					<p>When creating a branch, try to give it a short but unique name. For example, name the branch
						after the issue number it addresses.</p>

					<p>You can also add a prefix using a slash to the name make branches more specific (e.g.,
						"metadata/explain-title").</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Branch names must not contain spaces. Some tools will allow you to enter spaces in the name
							but will convert them to dashes when creating the actual branch.</p>
					</div>

					<p>This section reviews creating branches from the GitHub web site and the command line, but most
						applications for managing repositories can simplify this process for you.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>From the GitHub web site:</dt>
						<dd>
							<ol>
								<li>Go to the "Code" tab of the repository.</li>

			<section id="repo-changes">
				<h3>Managing changes</h3>

				<section id="pull-updates">
					<h4>Pulling the latest updates</h4>

					<p>Running a "pull" command gets the latest commits, branches, etc., from the source repository.</p>

					<p>To perform a pull command, run:</p>
					<pre><code>git pull</code></pre>

					<p>You should always run a pull command before starting new work on a specification to ensure your
						copy of the repository is up to date.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If you create a branch in GitHub, you need to run a pull command first before you can check
							it out to work on it.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="commits">
					<h4>Committing changes</h4>

					<p>Committing your changes saves them with git. Some people like to commit often (e.g., with each
						minor change) while other prefer to commit only when they are done all their changes. Either
						approach is fine.</p>

					<p>To make a commit, run:</p>
					<pre><code>git commit –a –m "explanatory message"</code></pre>

					<p>The "<code>-a</code>" flag in the preceding commands "adds" all changed files to your commit.
						Although a bit counter-intuitive, you must "add" changed files even if they already exist in the
						repository.</p>

					<p>The "<code>-m</code>" flag indicates the commit includes an explanatory message. For DAISY
						specifications, please always describe your commits. The description does not need to be long,
						but should make clear what you are committing.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Making commits does not push the changes to GitHub. Until you <a href="#push-changes"
								>push</a> them to the GitHub server, the changes will only exist in your local copy of
							the repository.</p>
					</div>

					<section id="file-maintenance">
						<h5>File maintenance</h5>

						<p>Although most commits involve edits to a specification, it is also common to make changes to
							the file structure of a repository (e.g., add images to a specification, or move or rename
							files). The following list details some common file maintenance commands. Running these
							commands still requires a commit.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>To add a single file to the repository, run:</p>
								<pre><code>git add filename.xyz</code></pre>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>To add all unversioned files, run:</p>
								<pre><code>git add -a</code></pre>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>To check for unversioned files, run:</p>
								<pre><code>git ls-files --other</code></pre>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>To delete a file, run:</p>
								<pre><code>git rm filename.xyz</code></pre>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>To rename a file, run:</p>
								<pre><code>git mv oldname.xyz newname.xyz</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="stash-changes">
					<h4>Stashing changes</h4>

					<p>Sometimes you may need to change branches or work on another issue while in the middle of
						editing. If you are not ready to commit the changes you have made, another option is to stash
						them.</p>

					<p>Stashing your changes stores them away in a stack and returns your branch to an unmodified
						state.</p>

					<p>When you return to the branch and are ready to continue editing, you can then "pop" the changes
						from the stash. (Note that you can pop the changes anywhere you want, so you can also pop the
						branches in a new branch if you prefer to start anew.)</p>

					<p>The most common stash commands are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>To stash changes, run:</p>
							<pre><code>git stash</code></pre>
							<p>or</p>
							<pre><code>git stash save "reminder message"</code></pre>
							<p>It is best to add a message to remind you what you were working on, as it is easy to
								forget what is in the stash if you have to go away to another issue for a long time.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>To view the list of stashed changes, run:</p>
							<pre><code>git stash list</code></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>To pop the top-most changes, run:</p>
							<pre><code>git pop</code></pre>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="push-changes">
					<h4>Pushing changes</h4>

					<p>To store your changes (<a href="#commits">commits</a>) on GitHub, you have to "push" them to the
						server.</p>

					<p>To push commits, run:</p>
					<pre><code>git push origin [branch-name]</code></pre>

					<p>Replacing "[branch-name]" with the name of the branch you are working in.</p>

					<p>As with committing, some people prefer to push their changes often while others prefer to wait
						until they are done. An advantage of pushing changes to GitHub often is that you know they are
						securely saved in case anything happens to your machine. A disadvantage is that undoing a commit
						once you have pushed it is more complicated (this is a bigger problem if you are working
						directly in the "main" branch where changes can go live right away).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Pushing your changes to GitHub does not <a href="#open-pr">open a pull request</a> to review

				<h3>ReSpec</h3>

				<section id="respec-intro">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>ReSpec is a JavaScript tool developed by the W3C to make editing their specifications easier and
						more consistent. The code allows you to focus on writing the content of the specification, while
						it takes care of adding common boilerplate and formatting when the document is viewed live.</p>

					<p>Although developed for W3C, ReSpec is no longer exclusively for developing W3C specifications.
						DAISY, for example, customizes a "base" profile to format its specifications and notes.</p>

					<p>The functioning of ReSpec is meant to be largely transparent to anyone editing specifications.
						Using the tool only requires a script tag to call in the ReSpec code and a block of JSON
						metadata to initialize it. Once these are set, editors will primarily be working in HTML to
						author the content. This means you can use whatever HTML editor you are most comfortable
						with.</p>

					<p>This section covers the setup and initialization of ReSpec. Information on how to tag HTML
						documents to take advantage of ReSpec's built-in formatting is covered in the next section on <a
							href="#editing">editing</a>.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>For detailed information on all aspects of ReSpec, please visit the <a
								href="https://respec.org/docs/">ReSpec Documentation</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="respec-config">
					<h4>Configuring a specification</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Configuring a ReSpec document for the first time is typically done by DAISY staff. You can
							skip this subsection if you are not interested in how the code is set up.</p>
					</div>

					<section id="respec-add">
						<h5>Adding the code</h5>

						<p>The ReSpec source code is hosted at
							<code>https://www.w3.org/Tools/respec/respec-w3c</code></p>

						<p>To call in this code, you only need to add a <code>script</code> tag to the HTML header.</p>

						<aside title="ReSpec script tag">
							<pre><code>&lt;html &#8230;>
   &lt;head>
      &#8230;
      &lt;script
         src="https://www.w3.org/Tools/respec/respec-w3c"
         class="remove">
      &lt;/script>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/head>
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>Note the use of the <code>class</code> attribute value "<code>remove</code>" on the
								<code>script</code> tag. This class ensures that ReSpec will remove the
								<code>script</code> tag (i.e., itself) when exporting a static version of the
							specification for publication.</p>

						<p>The only other requirement to get ReSpec working is to add the <a href="#respec-metadata"
								>initialization metadata</a>.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="respec-metadata">
						<h5>Adding the initialization metadata</h5>

						<p>ReSpec uses JSON metadata to initialize. This metadata is normally embedded in the
								<code>head</code> of the HTML document using a <code>script</code> tag. Although it is
							possible to import the metadata, doing so is not recommended. When stored outside the
							specification, the metadata is often forgotten and not updated.</p>

						<p>The <code>script</code> tag must contain a <code>respecConfig</code> variable definition,
							which in turn must be an object. They key/value pairs in this object define the
							initialization parameters.</p>

						<aside title="ReSpec metadata script tag and variable">
							<pre><code>&lt;html &#8230;>
   &lt;head>
      &#8230;
      &lt;script
         src="https://www.w3.org/Tools/respec/respec-w3c"
         class="remove">
      &lt;/script>
      &lt;script class="remove">
         var respecConfig = {
            …
         }
      &lt;/script>
   &lt;/head>
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>The initialization metadata controls such aspects of the document as the links at the top of
							the document (current version, previous version, etc.), the lists of editors and authors,
							etc.</p>

						<p>Setting the various metadata properties goes beyond this tutorial, however. Refer to the <a
								href="https://respec.org/docs/">ReSpec Documentation</a> for more information.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="respec-confirm">
						<h5>Confirming the ReSpec setup</h5>

						<p>Once the ReSpec code and initialization metadata are set, all you need to do to verify the
							setup is open the document in a browser.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Although you can open a ReSpec document on your local file system by double-clicking it,
								it is often better to use a server like Apache or IIS to serve the document. If your
								specification uses ReSpec file includes, for example, these will only work from a
								server.</p>
						</div>

						<p>If the configuration is successful, you will get an HTML document with a table of contents on
							one side and a ReSpec button positioned at the top left.</p>

						<img src="images/respec-button.png" width="100" alt="Respec button" />

						<p>If the ReSpec button is present, there is nothing else you need to do but reload the document
							to view your changes as you go. If you click on the ReSpec button, it only provides options
							to export the specification (for publication) and to search for references.</p>

						<p>If the ReSpec button is missing, then initialization failed. In this case, check the
							browser's JavaScript console (in the browser tools) for more information. The most common
							problem is invalid JSON in the initialization metadata (e.g., a missing comma).</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="respec-err-warn">
					<h4>Errors and warnings</h4>

					<p>ReSpec will alert you to any errors and warnings it can detect.</p>

					<p>For errors, a red oval button with a number indicating the number of errors will appear beside
						the ReSpec box at the top of the document.</p>

					<img src="images/respec-errors.png" width="175" alt="Error indicator" />

					<p>Click on the oval to get a list of errors.</p>

					<p>Warnings are the same, but the indicator is a yellow oval.</p>

					<img src="images/respec-warnings.png" width="175" alt="Warning indicator" />

					<p>Make sure all errors are fixed. Not all warnings need fixing, but they need to be evaluated on a
						case-by-case basis.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="spec-structure">
				<h3>Sectioning specifications</h3>

				<section id="sections">
					<h4>Using sections</h4>

					<p>Section tags are an important part of structuring a specification, and you must author DAISY
						specifications using <code>section</code> tags around each self-contained section of
						content.</p>

					<p>Every <code>section</code> tag should contain a unique ID in its <code>id</code> attribute.
						Although ReSpec will add IDs if they are missing (with the value match the heading), relying on
						this feature is strongly discouraged. If you later change your title, for example, links to it
						will break if you rely on ReSpec's dynamic identifying.</p>

					<p>The <code>section</code> tag is also used to differentiate <a href="#informative-sections"
							>informative content</a> from <a href="#normative-sections">normative content</a>, as
						described in more detail in the next two subsections.</p>

					<p>In addition, every section must have a heading. Ensure that the number of heading tag matches its
						nesting. The top-most sections in a specification must have <code>h2</code> headings – ReSpec
						uses <code>h1</code> for the document title.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>ReSpec will attempt to correct misnumbered heading tags.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Use sentence case for headings &#8212; only the first letter is capitalized unless there are also
						proper nouns in the title.</p>

					<p>Do not add numbers your headings (e.g., "<code>&lt;h2>1. &#8230;&lt;/h2></code>"). ReSpec will
						add the correct numbering based on whether the content is preliminary, body, or back matter.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If a heading occurs without a <code>section</code> tag, ReSpec will attempt to add one to
							match what it infers to be the correct structure (usually by making a subsection). Be
							careful about relying on this kind of auto-correction.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="normative-sections">
					<h4>Normative sections</h4>

					<p>All specifications are composed of normative and informative sections. Normative sections include
						the requirements the author, reading system, etc. must follow.</p>

					<p>In DAISY specifications, all sections are normative by default. You do not need to specially mark
						these sections as normative.</p>

					<p>Specifications must include a <a href="#spec-conformance">Conformance section</a>. This section
						explains the <a href="#normative-statements">normative keywords</a> used in the document.</p>

					<section id="normative-statements">
						<h5>Normative statements</h5>

						<p>Normative sections are composed of one or more requirements. These requirements must be
							identified by special keywords identified in [[rfc2119]].</p>

						<p>These keywords include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><code>MUST</code>, <code>MUST NOT</code>, and <strong>REQUIRED</strong> – if the target
								of the statement (content, reading system, etc.) does not meet these requirements it is
								non-conforming.</li>
							<li><code>SHOULD</code>, <code>SHOULD NOT</code>, and <code>RECOMMENDED</code> – the target
								of the statement should only deviate from these requirements if there is a good
								reason.</li>
							<li><code>MAY</code> and <code>OPTIONAL</code> – meeting these requirements is at the
								discretion of the author or developer.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="note">
							<p>DAISY specifications should not use keywords SHALL and SHALL NOT. They are equivalent to
								the "must" keywords and only add confusion.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Normative keywords must be in uppercase. Lowercase keywords have no normative weight, but it
							best to avoid these as they confuse most readers.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="informative-sections">
					<h4>Informative sections</h4>

					<p>Informative sections are for explanatory or illustrative content. They must not contain normative
						statements and should avoid the lowercase equivalents (confuses readers whether the section is
						misidentified as informative).</p>

					<p>Informative sections must be identified by adding an "informative" class to them.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="An informative section">
						<pre><code>&lt;section class="informative">
   &lt;h3>Examples&lt;/h3>
   &#8230;
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Be careful how you use the informative class. It applies to the section it is added to as well as
						any subsections that section contains. Marking an entire <a href="#introductions"
							>introduction</a> informative, for example, could incorrectly result in the <a
							href="#spec-conformance">conformance section</a> and <a href="#spec-terminology">terminology
							section</a> becoming informative.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Examples and notes are always considered informative – no special marker is needed.</p>

				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="prelim">
				<h3>Preliminary matter</h3>

				<section id="title-and-subtitle">
					<h4>Title and subtitle</h4>

					<p>The title of the specification is specified in the document's <code>title</code> tag.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Setting the title for a specification">
						<pre><code>&lt;html &#8230;>
   &lt;head>
      &lt;title>eBraille&lt;/title>
   &lt;/head>
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>ReSpec automatically generates an <code>h1</code> in the body using the same value.</p>

					<p>You can add an <code>h1</code> tag with the id "<code>title</code>" to the body if you need html
						tags in the title, but this is rare.</p>

					<p>To add a subtitle, include an <code>h2</code> tag with the id "<code>title</code>".</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Inlined title and subtitle">
						<pre><code>&lt;body>
   &lt;h1 id="title">Introducing the &lt;code>details&lt;/code> element&lt;/h1>

&lt;/body></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Do not place the title and subtitle inside <code>section</code> tags.</p>

					<p>Subtitling specifications is usually rare. Use an <a href="#spec-abstract">abstract</a> to
						describe the specification.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="copyright">
					<h4>Copyright</h4>

					<p>ReSpec will automatically add a W3C copyright statement if one is not provided in the document.
						To avoid this behavior, add a DAISY copyright statement after the opening body tag.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="DAISY copyright">
						<pre><code>&lt;body>
   &lt;p class="copyright">Copyright &#169; DAISY Consortium 2023&lt;/p>
   &#8230;

					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If the document has a title or subtitle in the body, the copyright can proceed these
							tags.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="spec-abstract">
					<h4>Abstract</h4>

					<p>ReSpec requires every document have an abstract that briefly explains the document.</p>

					<p>To add the abstract, include a <code>section</code> with the id "<code>abstract</code>".</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Default abstract section tagging">
						<pre><code>&lt;section id="abstract">
   &lt;p>&#8230;&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Do not add a heading for the abstract. ReSpec will automatically add one.</p>
					</div>

					<p>The abstract should only be a few sentences at most. Leave longer explanations for an
						introductory section.</p>

					<p>If you are writing a document that does not need an abstract (e.g., a note), you can suppress the
						section by adding the html <code>hidden</code> attribute. Removing the table of contents entry
						requires scripting, however. Contact DAISY staff to help with this task.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="spec-sotd">
					<h4>Status of this document</h4>

					<p>DAISY specifications do not include status sections. Do not include a <code>section</code> tag
						with the id "<code>sotd</code>" as this will trigger ReSpec to include W3C boilerplate.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>There is no way to overwrite the W3C boilerplate. ReSpec will append any text you write in a

						<p>If DAISY specifications add status sections in the future, a new method for including them
							will be developed.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="spec-toc">
					<h4>Table of contents</h4>

					<p>ReSpec automatically generates the table of contents from the heading structure.</p>

					<p>How many levels deep the table of contents go can be controlled by the <a href="#respec-metadata"

					<p>Individual sections can be omitted from the table of contents by adding the class
							"<code>noTOC</code>" to them.</p>

      &#8212;
   &lt;/section>
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Do not mark the introduction as informative unless all the subsections it contains are also
						informative.</p>

					<p>The following sections explain the most common subsections found in the introduction, but you can
						add any additional explanatory subsections you need.</p>

					<section id="spec-overview">
						<h5>Overviews and Backgrounds</h5>

						<p>An overview section provides you the opportunity to informatively describe the purpose, scope
							and features of the specification in more detail than the <a href="#abstract">abstract</a>
							allows. It is generally recommended to always include one in DAISY specifications.</p>

						<p>Make sure mark the overview as informative.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Overview section">
							<pre><code>&lt;section id="overview" class="informative">
   &lt;h3>Overview&lt;/h3>
   
   &lt;p>
      The need for a common digital braille format &#8212;
   &lt;/p>
&lt;/section></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>DAISY specifications may also contain background sections, although these are not common. A
							background section differs from an overview in that it delves into the problems that led to
							creating the specification, for example, or outlines how the specification is a response to
							previous efforts. The background should typically follow the overview.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Background section">
							<pre><code>&lt;section id="background" class="informative">
   &lt;h3>Background&lt;/h3>
   
   &lt;p>

   &lt;/p>
&lt;/section></code></pre>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="spec-conformance">
						<h5>Conformance</h5>

						<p>DAISY specifications must have a conformance section. This section should go after the <a
								href="#spec-overview">Overview</a>.</p>

						<p>You should not include any text in the conformance section or give it a heading. ReSpec will
							automatically populate the required text.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Empty conformance section">
							<pre><code>&lt;section id="conformance">&lt;/section></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>If you do add content to the section, ReSpec adds it after the boilerplate it generates.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>If you are writing an informative note, not a specification, omit a conformance section.
								ReSpec will emit a warning, but this can be ignored.</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section id="spec-terminology">
						<h5>Terminology</h5>

						<p>If your specification uses terms that need defining, add a terminology section in the
							introductory material. This section typically follows the <a href="spec-conformance"
								>conformance section</a>.</p>

						<p>Within the terminology section, add a definition list (<code>dl</code> tag) to define the
							terms.</p>

						<p>Each <code>dt</code> must include a <code>dfn</code> tag around the term. This allows ReSpec
							to harvest the terminology and simplify linking to terms.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Typical terminology section">
							<pre><code>&lt;section id="terminology">
   &lt;h2>Terminology&lt;/h2>
   
   &lt;dl>
      &lt;dt>&lt;dfn>Term&lt;/dfn>&lt;/dt>
     
      &lt;dd>
         &lt;p>Definition&lt;/p>
      &lt;/dd>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/dl>
&lt;/section</code></pre>

						</aside>

						<p>Never include normative requirements in a terminology section! Users do not expect to find
							implementation details in definitions. Add requirements to a section most applicable to the
							term.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Terminology is always considered a normative part of a specification even if it does not
								contain normative requirements. Do not mark the section as informative.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Once a term is defined, you can reference it from an <code>a</code> tag anywhere in the
							document. You do not have to include a <code>href</code> attribute.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Link to a definition">
							<pre><code>When the &lt;a>reading system&lt;/a> opens the document &#8230;</code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>Only the first instance of a term in a new section is linked to its definition.</p>

						<p>ReSpec can handle differences in case between the link text and the defined term. It can also
							account for most plural forms of words.</p>

						<p>If you intend to use a shorthand expression of the term (e.g., "reading system" instead of
							"eBraille reading system", you need to define the alternative in the term definition using a
								<code>data-lt</code> attribute.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Defining an alternative term">
							<pre><code>&lt;dt>&lt;dfn data-lt="reading system">
   eBraille Reading System
&lt;/dfn>&lt;/dt></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>If there is more than one alternative, use a vertical bar (<code>|</code>) to separate the
							terms in the attribute.</p>

				<h3>Body matter</h3>

				<section id="body-write">
					<h4>How to write the body</h4>

					<p>Probably the toughest problem you will face when writing a specification is how to structure it
						and what to write about.</p>

					<p>Although there is no simple answer to how to write a specification, the best way to begin the
						process is often to brainstorm a list of topics that you expect you will have to cover. Start by
						coming up with a list of top-level concepts or technologies you expect to define and then work
						at refining this list by filling in the subsections.</p>

					<p>Do not worry about getting this initial outline perfect &#8230; finished specifications almost
						never look anything like they did at the outset. You will only discover what you ultimately need
						to add and how to arrange the information as you go.</p>

					<p>Once you have an outline of topics, a useful next step is to think of a specification as a
						teaching guide. You need to introduce your readers to the concepts in a logical sequence that
						allows them to build on the aspects they have already learned. Try arranging your outline so
						that readers do not depend on understanding concepts that are only explained later.</p>

					<p>Finally, do not feel compelled to fill in a specification from top-to-bottom. Begin wherever you
						feel most comfortable and work your way through. Some parts will be much easier to write than
						others and will require less input from the group. Getting some easy wins will make the process
						more rewarding than struggling with harder parts just because they come first.</p>

						<p>The rest of this section deals with writing conveniences provided by ReSpec.</p>

				<section id="writing-guidelines">
					<h3>Writing guidelines</h3>

					<p>Use the following guidelines when writing DAISY specifications:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Use US English spelling</li>
						<li>Follow the Chicago Manual of Style grammar and formatting rules</li>
						<li>Do not use contractions (don't, can't, etc.)</li>
						<li>Do not use personal pronouns (I, we, you, etc.)</li>

					<h4>Cross-references</h4>

					<p>To cross-reference another section in your specification, use an <code>a</code> tag that
						references the ID of the section.</p>

					<p>If you do not put any text in the <code>a</code> tag, ReSpec will automatically add the number
						and title of the section. (You can also use ReSpec's triple bracket shorthand for referencing
						sections this way: <code>[[[<code>#id</code>]]]</code>.)</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Cross-reference with text label">
						<pre><code>For more information, refer to the
&lt;a href="#html-restrictions">HTML restrictions&lt;/a>.</code></pre>
					</aside>

					<aside class="example" title="Cross-reference without text label">
						<p>In this example, if the section with the ID "html-restrictions" is the sixth in the document
							and has the heading "HTML restricted elements", ReSpec will create the label "6. HTML
							restricted elements" for the link.</p>
						<pre><code>For more information, refer to
&lt;a href="#html-restrictions">&lt;/a>.</code></pre>
						<pre><code>For more information, refer to [[[#html-restrictions]]].</code></pre>

				<section id="refs">
					<h4 id="ref-hd">References</h4>

					<section id="ref-specs" aria-labelledby="ref-hd ref-specs-hd">
						<h5 id="ref-specs-hd">To other specifications</h5>

						<p>When referencing elements, attributes, definitions, concepts, etc. another specification, you
							must cite the specification.</p>

						<p>ReSpec supports a shorthand syntax for specification references using two brackets on either
							side of the specification's shortname: <code>[[\shortname]]</code></p>

						<p>To find the shortname to use for a specification, go to <a href="https://specref.org"
								>https://specref.org</a> (there is also a link to this page from the ReSpec button).</p>

						<p>Specification references may be normative or informative. References inherit this designation
							from the type of section they are in.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Normative reference">
							<pre><code>&lt;section id="toc-req">
   &lt;h2>Table of contents requirements&lt;/h2>
   &lt;p>The table of contents MUST be defined in an [[html]] [^nav^] element.&lt;/p>
   &#8230;
&lt;/section></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<aside class="example" title="Informative reference in a note">
							<p>Because notes are informative, the reference becomes informative.</p>
							<pre><code>&lt;div class="note">
   &lt;p>The [[html]] [^details^] element still has support issues
      in some reading systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>If informative references are used in normative sections, you must mark the reference as
							informative by adding a question mark before the shortname.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Informative reference in a normative section">
							<pre><code>Images MUST include alternative text (e.g., in the [[?html]] [^img^]
element's [^img/alt^] attribute).</code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>Normative references are not allowed in informative content.</p>

						<p>ReSpec automatically builds a references section in the back matter and sorts the references
							into normative and informative subsections.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="ref-markup" aria-labelledby="ref-hd ref-markup-hd">
						<h5 id="ref-markup-hd">To elements and attributes</h5>

						<p>ReSpec also has a shorthand for linking to elements in other specifications using a bracket
							and circumflex around the element's name: <code>[^<code>element</code>^]</code></p>

						<aside class="example" title="Reference to the HTML iframe element">
							<pre><code>The [[html]] [^iframe^] element &#8230;</code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>To reference an attribute, you typically add a slash after the element's name:
									<code>[^<code>element/attribute</code>^]</code></p>

						<aside class="example" title="Reference to the HTML img element's src attribute">
							<pre><code>The [^img/src^] attribute &#8230;</code></pre>
						</aside>

						<div class="note">
							<p>ReSpec replaces the attribute shorthand with the attribute's actual name. In the previous
								example, only "The <code>src</code> attribute" will appear in the rendered text.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Element and attribute shorthands are only available for HTML and SVG.</p>

						<p>If you are unsure what shorthand to use, or are getting an error, go to <a
								href="https://respec.org/xref/">https://respec.org/xref/</a> and make sure you have the
							correct reference.</p>

						<p>If more than one specification defines an element or attribute, you may need to tell ReSpec
							which one you mean to reference by adding a <code>data-cite</code> attribute. The value of
							this attribute is the same shorthand name you use to <a href="#ref-specs">reference the
								specification</a>.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Identifying the link element's source">
							<pre><code>&lt;p data-cite="html">The [[html]] [^link^] element …&lt;/p></code></pre>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section id="ref-concepts" aria-labelledby="ref-hd ref-concept-hd">
						<h5 id="ref-concept-hd">To concepts and definitions</h5>

						<p>Concepts and definitions are defined in <code>dfn</code> tags.</p>

						<p>ReSpec has a shorthand for referencing these using a bracket and equals sign around the term:
									<code>[=<code>term</code>=]</code></p>

						<aside class="example" title="Referencing a concept">
							<pre><code>&#8230; the &lt;dfn>base url of the container&lt;/dfn> is &#8230;
&#8230;
When appending the [=base url of the container=] &#8230;
</code></pre>
						</aside>

						<p>Concepts can be defined either in the current specification or in another, like [[infra]] or
							[[url]].</p>

				<section id="adding-notes">
					<h4>Adding notes</h4>

					<p>There are two main types of notes:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>Regular notes</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Regular notes are like asides &#8230; they are used to informatively describe issues to
								readers.</p>
							<p>To add a note, use the class "<code>note</code>".</p>
							<aside class="example" title="Typical note markup">
								<pre><code>&lt;div class="note">
   &lt;p>Note text&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
							</aside>
							<p>You can also add a descriptive caption using the <code>title</code> attribute but, this
								is not commonly done for notes.</p>
							<p>If a note is only a single paragraph, you can use the <code>note</code> class directly on
								the paragraph tag. The one downside of this approach is that it makes notes slightly
								hard to spot visually when editing (the extra <code>div</code> wrapper makes the
								paragraph stand out from any others around it.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt>Editor's notes</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Editor's notes inform readers about issues that are still to be addressed in the
								specification.</p>
							<p>To add an editor's note, use the class "<code>ednote</code>".</p>
							<aside class="example" title="Typical editor note markup">
								<pre><code>&lt;div class="ednote">
   &lt;p>Note text&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
							</aside>
							<div class="note">
								<p>Editor's notes are only allowed while you are working on the specification. They must
									be removed prior to final publication.</p>
							</div>
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>

				<section id="adding-examples">
					<h4>Adding examples</h4>

					<p>To add examples, use an <code>aside</code> tag with the class "<code>example</code>".</p>

					<p>Use the <code>title</code> attribute to add a descriptive caption for the example. It is strongly
						recommended to title examples to make it easier for readers to understand their purpose.</p>

					<p>Use <code>&lt;pre></code> and <code>&lt;code></code> tags to wrap the example markup.</p>

					<aside>
						<pre><code>&lt;aside class="example" title="Adding foo to bar">
   &lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;p> &amp;#8230;&amp;lt;/p>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/aside></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Make sure to escape opening brackets in the example.</p>
					</div>

					<p>If necessary, you can add a more thorough description of the example using <code>&lt;p></code>
						tags.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Example with description">
						<pre><code>&lt;aside class="example" title="Adding bar to foo">
   &lt;p>In the example, the foo is &#8230; &lt;/p>
   &#8230;
&lt;/aside></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>ReSpec will automatically number examples.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="backmatter">
				<h3>Back matter</h3>

				<section id="adding-app">
					<h4>Adding appendixes</h4>

					<p>Marking a section as an appendix changes its numbering to alphabetic and signifies it is in the
						back matter.</p>

					<p>To indicate a section is an appendix, add the class <code>appendix</code> to its
							<code>section</code> tag.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="A section marked as an appendix">
						<pre><code>&lt;section class="appendix">
   &#8230;
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Appendixes are not informative by default, but they are typically used for informative content.
						An informative class must be added if the appendix is not normative.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="An informative appendix">
						<pre><code>&lt;section class="appendix informative">
   &#8230;
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Appendixes must be the last sections in the document. ReSpec will convert all sections after the
						first marked as an appendix to appendices, whether you wanted them as appendixes or not!</p>
				</section>

				<section id="spec-change-log">
					<h4>Change log entries</h4>

					<p>ReSpec currently does not help you out with change logs.</p>

					<p>Change log entries should be dated and provide a concise description of the change. Best practice
						is to also include a link to the GitHub issue for each entry.</p>

					<aside>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>
   2023-10-12 &#8212; Updated parsing algorithm for the
   table of contents. Refer to &lt;a
   href="https://www.github.com/daisy/ex/issues/234">issue
   234&lt;/a>.
&lt;/li></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>A change log may not be needed for a new specification but can help readers track changes since
						the last publication.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="custom-css">
				<h3>Custom styling</h3>

				<p>Although ReSpec provides a default look and feel, it does not cover everything you may need when
					writing a specification.</p>

				<p>To use custom styling, simply add a <code>style</code> tag to the document header with the necessary
					CSS.</p>

				<p>Do not change the appearance of specifications just because you do not like the ReSpec defaults!
					Limit custom CSS to unhandled needs.</p>
